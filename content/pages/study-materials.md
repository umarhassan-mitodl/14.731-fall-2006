## The Search for Data: Finding and Using Published Sources

Note that finding primary sources is easiest for the United States. You can find a fair number of primary sources for Britain and somewhat fewer for France. Other countries present even greater difficulties. Keep this in mind in thinking about topics. Students who end up focusing on the 1970s onwards because they cannot find earlier data tend not to do well on the paper.

## Machine Readable Data

Hardly any non-U.S. data are available. Most of the U.S. data date from the end of the nineteenth century onwards.

Most publicly available data are stored with ICPSR. To browse their collection, {{% resource_link "3d055ae3-9f80-48e0-9050-0d22445ef586" "Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research" %}}.

Available ICPSR data:

1. Published census material.
2. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer expenditure surveys, as well as state Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys (end of nineteenth century, beginning of twentieth).
3. U.S. census of manufacturing (nineteenth century).
4. Voting data.
5. Slave sales, prices, and appraisals.
6. Military muster rolls.
7. Wills, probate, and tax records (including English).
8. Payroll records of selected companies (e.g. Ford).
9. Arrests, strikes, and violent activity in France and Britain.
10. Aggregate statistics for Europe.

Data archives similar to ICPSR exist in other countries as well.

Historical newspaper databases include Proquest's *New York Times* Historical Archives and Historical *Wall Street Journal* and are accessible from the libraries Web page.

Note that MIT keeps older material, including published census volumes, in its Retrospective Collection (RSC). Primary sources are also available at Harvard's Widener, Littauer (federal and state government reports), Lamont (census volumes), Guttman (education volumes), and Baker (business history) libraries.
